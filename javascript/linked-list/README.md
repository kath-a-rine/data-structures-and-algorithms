# Singly Linked List/Linked List Insertions/k-th value/zipped-lists


## Challenge

Code Challenge 5 -

* Create a Linked List class
* Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
* Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
* The class should contain the following methods: `insert`, `includes`, `toString`
* Write tests to prove the functionality

### Code Challenge 6 - Extend a Linked List to allow various insertion methods.

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

* **append**
  * arguments: new value
  * adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* **insert before**
  * arguments: value, new value
  * adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
* **insert after**
  * arguments: value, new value
  * adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

### Code Challenge 7 - extending implementation

Write the following method for the Linked List class:

* kth from end
  * argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
  * Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
  * You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
