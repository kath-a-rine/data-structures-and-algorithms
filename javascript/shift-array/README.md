# Insert to Middle of an Array

## Whiteboard Process

![array insert shift whiteboard](./array-insert-shift.png)

## Approach & Efficiency

I was unable to get the code I wrote to shift the other values index's over one. Submitting the code I was playing with for now.

I worked with Elizabeth Hammes on the whiteboard.
