# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

### Code Challenge 10: Implementation

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

#### Node

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

#### Stack

- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
  - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
  - The class should contain the following methods:
  - push
    - Arguments: value
    - adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
  - pop
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
    - Removes the node from the top of the stack
    - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
  - peek
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
    - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
  - is empty
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

#### Queue

- Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
  - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
  - The class should contain the following methods:
  - enqueue
    - Arguments: value
    - adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
  - dequeue
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
    - Removes the node from the front of the queue
    - Should raise exception when called on empty queue
  - peek
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
    - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
  - is empty
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

### Code Challenge 11: Implement a Queue using two Stacks

- Create a new class called pseudo queue.
  - Do not use an existing Queue.
  - Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
  - Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
- Methods:
  - enqueue
    - Arguments: value
    - Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
  - dequeue
    - Arguments: none
    - Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency

CC10: for this code challenge I reviewed the reading and referred to the demo code from lecture. I started with writing my tests first.

## API
